# SNAPPY

## Description
Snappy is a software built to make easier the management of taking snapshots and storing them in a server.

This is the client side, that is in charge of taking the snapshots and sending them to the server and also retrieve the snapshots from the server.

**WARNING**
Snappy is a project made by a guy who isn't a professional, therefore the code is a big mess. If you really want to have a look at it, do it at your own risk.
Also, knowing that this project will not be noticed by anyone, the structure of it isn't that good. I will try to improve it, but don't expect anything.

If you want to collaborate (moved by pity) just do a pull request. I will take a look and (almost surely) accept it.


P.S. For now, the client side is incomplete. The only feature working is the one to take a snapshot (I think, I haven't had time to test it yet). If you have a compatible server and want to try it, feel free to do it :)
